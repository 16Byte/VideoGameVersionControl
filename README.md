# VideoGameVersionControl
A tool that allows players to leverage the abilities of git to easily version control their game states. Whether it be version controlling your ksp mod setup, your minecraft world saves, or even something larger like a Satisfactory save. This tool can version control it with a sleek graphical user interface. This project is open for collaboration.
